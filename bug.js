This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an incorrect or missing `keyExtractor` prop.  The `keyExtractor` function is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and render items.  Without a unique key for each item, FlatList may produce unexpected behavior, including incorrect rendering or performance issues.  The error message itself might not explicitly state 'missing keyExtractor', but the symptoms will point towards it.  Common symptoms include incorrect item placement, missing items, or duplicate items after updates.  Another manifestation can be the dreaded "Maximum update depth exceeded" error, as React Native struggles to reconcile changes due to missing keys.
